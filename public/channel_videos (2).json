Some countries are still importing hundreds of thousands of tons each year, and it's estimated that by 2035, nearly 2.8 million people might die because of it. This is a video about a deadly miracle material we can't stop using. This investigation is based on publicly available documents, recordings, and third party sources. All of our links are in the description. Thank you to Ground News for sponsoring this video. More about them later. There is this story about the ancient Greeks from around the 2nd century AD. They had this golden lantern that would burn for a whole year without going out. All because of a very special wick that just wouldn't burn down. So, how did they develop this technology? Well, the truth is they didn't. They've found it. Imagine you're walking around 2,000 years ago and you see this fluffy looking stuff poking out the ground. It's got all of these fibers that you can pull apart and twist into shapes. First off, let's get a nice bundle. So, it looks like cotton. Uh, >> it looks like it would burn really well. Like it would just >> Yeah, you can start a fire with it, right? All right. >> Okay, let's see what happens. It's not burning. That's because this is actually a rock. It's a naturally occurring mineral. The core building block is simple. It's a silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms. Now, silicon has four electrons in its outer shell, but it really wants eight. So, each of the oxygen shares one electron with it, but oxygen doesn't share evenly. Since it's more electrogative than silicon, it pulls those shared electrons closer to itself. This leaves the oxygen side slightly negative and the silicon side slightly positive. Now there's an electrostatic attraction between these atoms which pulls the atoms closer together and strengthens this bond. The result is an incredibly stable pyramid-shaped unit called a silica tetrahedrin. But if you look at the oxygens in these corner spots, they've only shared one electron, but they actually want two to complete their outer shells. So the corners link up with other silicon atoms to form more tetrahedra. And in this way, the structure just keeps growing. The bonds inside here are incredibly strong and stable. And because the atoms are already tightly bound to the oxygen inside the silicate structure, the oxygen in the air has nothing to react with. So the material doesn't burn. But overall, there's nothing special about these building blocks. More than 90% of the Earth's minerals are made from this stuff. everything from quartz to clay. What makes this material special is how those units link up. Here the tetrahedra have formed a sheet and bonded to it there is actually a second sheet made of magnesium atoms and hydroxal groups which are just an oxygen and a hydrogen stuck together. Now the atomic spacings of these two layers are slightly different. So there's a tiny mismatch which causes tension between these layers causing them to curl up and you end up with these tiny scroll-like tubes. These tubes don't break down easily under heat. The structure stays stable up to around 600° C. >> So like all these individual fibers that you see running through here, those are all like these scrolls more. >> What is that? What was that bend? >> That's just a place where I twisted the fiber with my tweezers. Ah, >> okay. And when you twist these fibers, they actually don't break. So it's literally a rock you can weave. And when you do, the fibers form a tangled layered structure. So if heat is introduced, it has to pass from fiber to fiber a"

    "transcript": "In the summer of 1841, Florida doctor John Gory faced a dire situation. Yellow fever, also known as the black vomit, was [music] sweeping through his town, wiping out entire families. Patients came to Gory's small infirmary jaundest and burning with fevers up to 40° C. To cool his patients down, Gory couldn't turn to refrigeration because that hadn't been invented yet. So, he came up with a radical treatment. He suspended pans of ice in his infirmary, allowing [music] the cool, dense air to flow down over his patients, providing much needed relief. But this treatment [music] was almost impossible to sustain because it required hundreds of kg of ice per day. And Gory had only one way to get it. He relied on ice blocks that were transported thousands of kilometers through a now [music] forgotten ice empire. A vast network of ships and ice houses, all built and controlled by one [music] man, known to the world as the Ice King. Over the previous 35 years, he had forged a monopoly that spanned the globe, and anyone who wanted ice was at his mercy. Gory only got a few deliveries each year. And now by the peak of summer, the cost of just a few days ice for the infirmary would have been more expensive than the average yearly wage. So locals began to refer to the ice as white gold. As Gory's supply ran out, he was forced to watch his patients suffer and die. It was in that moment that he decided he would find a way to free the world from the grip of the Ice King. By the turn of the 19th century, most of America's ice came from the northern states, where thousands of square kilometers of lakes would freeze over for much of the year. The hard part was getting all that ice out. To get ice out of a lake or river, first of all, you had to trust that it was deep enough to support your weight. Then there's no way to really tell. Then you had to walk out several [music] feet onto this plane of ice, take a saw that's as long as I am tall, and then carve [music] the very ice that you're standing on and just, you know, hope to heaven that it doesn't sink. [music] Then you had to kind of float it to shore and a horse would help to [music] kind of pull the ice into the back of a wagon. It was frequently common for the the harvesters and their horses to fall through into the ice. sometimes [music] to their death. >> This dangerous and painstaking process meant that ice remained a rare commodity available mostly to wealthy land owners. One of the few who had access to it was 22-year-old Boston merchant [music] Frederick Tutor. In the winter of 1805, Tutor was thinking back to a tragic incident that had happened 4 years earlier. He and his brother came down with a bad fever while visiting the Caribbean. Back home, they would have just asked their [music] servants to get some ice. But on the islands, ice was unheard of. With no way to cool down, the brothers cut their trip [music] short and returned to America. And while Frederick recovered, his brother [music] did not. Today, we know that ice wouldn't have saved his brother's life because he likely suffered from a rare case of bone tuberculosis. But at the time, Tutor believed that it was the lack of ice on the islands that was responsible for his brother's death. It was this painful memory that gave him an idea. What if he could be the one to bring ice to the Caribbean and in the process make his fortune? So, Tutor got to work. He hired dozens of men to gather ice and approached investors to help finance a ship. But to the investors, this plan seemed ridiculous. Tutor wrote, [music] \"People only laugh when I tell them I'm going to carry ice to the West Indies, which is understandable because the journey would [music] take 3 weeks sailing through warm seas under the blazing Caribbean sun. I mean, can you really transport [music] ice in those conditions for that long? Wouldn't it all just melt?\" It turns out people had figured out ways to make ice last a long time, even thousands of years ago. As far back as 500 BC, in the scorching summers of the Persian Empire, ancient kings like Xerxes enjoyed refreshing frozen desserts, even when the outside temperature climbed as high as 35° C. Now, ice in the desert might seem strange, but during the winter months, temperatures can drop dramatically. So, the Persians filled shallow pools with water, which would freeze overnight, and in the morning, they would break up the ice sheets and collect the pieces. To make that ice [music] last until the summer, they used three key techniques. >> Let's try a simple experiment. I have eight ice cubes spread evenly in one dish here. And I have another eight ice cubes now stacked together in one mega cube in [music] this dish over here. Now, if you leave these two plates to melt for a few hours, the [music] stacked ice cubes fare a lot better. And that's because the main way ice melts is through heat conduction on its surface. So even though the volume was the same, the surface area exposed here is double"

    "transcript": "Imagine you're [music] in empty space and you fire off a stream of electrons. Well, then according to [music] most physics textbooks, the only way to change how those electrons behave is by applying an electric or magnetic [music] or gravitational force to them. But most physics textbooks are wrong. In the 1950s, two physicists came up with [music] a clever experiment. You could have electrons travel through a region with no electric or magnetic fields whatsoever. And yet by flipping a switch, you could change their behavior. The magnetic field could be just zero. [music] And yet the presence of some quantity could actually lead to observable effects. That wasn't supposed to happen, right? This experiment split the physics community in two. It made them question whether fields are fundamental [music] or whether something that was supposed to be just an abstract mathematical tool was actually more [music] core to reality. This tool was first introduced in an attempt to solve one of the hardest unsolved problems in physics, the threebody problem. That is, if you have three bodies and you know their initial positions and velocities, how will they move under the influence of each other's gravity? It's a juicy juicy problem which has occupied literally generations, hundreds of hundreds of years of incredibly ambitious, talented mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers and and and beyond. The fact that this problem is so difficult to solve should at least be a little surprising because if you have just two bodies, then the solution is easy to find. In fact, the general case was already solved over 300 years ago by Newton himself. But when [music] Newton added a third body, well, that's when everything fell apart. In the two-body case, the forces behaved predictably, always pointing toward the systems shared center of mass. But with three bodies, this is no longer the case. When you try to calculate the forces, they end up being extremely dynamic. In addition to worrying about the magnitude of the forces, you also have to worry about their direction. So you end up with this chaotic mess of vectors. For the next 100 years, everyone who tried to solve this problem failed. But what if there was some other way to approach it? A way to simplify the math and not have to worry about these three-dimensional vectors? Well, that's where Joseph Louie Lrangee comes in. In the 1770s, he was also trying to solve the threebody problem and he came up with a new approach. It works something like this. Say you've got a single mass like a star. Lrange imagined assigning a value to each point in space [music] around the star. The value is determined by the stars mass and the distance from the [music] star. You can think of each value as a height. And if we then turn this into an altitude map, you can see how the star creates this sort [music] of well. What Lrange had developed was the gravitational potential V. And what's important to note is that V is a scalar. It has a magnitude but no direction. So the genius in Lrange's idea is this. At any given point, we can draw an arrow pointing directly downhill where the size of the arrow corresponds to the steepness of the hill at that point. We can repeat this process at every point. And if we then shift our perspective to two dimensions, look what we've got is the gravitational field of the star. Mathematically, we say that the gravitational field G is equal to the negative gradient of V. So like Branchet found a way to switch the problem back and forth between one of vectors and one of scalers. And while adding up vectors is hard, adding scalers is a piece of cake. To find the combined potential landscape of any number of bodies, you just add up their individual potentials. And then you can always use that to get back the forces if you want. For a simple two-body system like the Earth orbiting the Sun, that combined potential looks something like this. If you look closely, you see that there are five points where the gradient is zero. And so Lrange realized the forces there are also zero. which means that at each of these points you could place a tiny third body and it would maintain a perfectly stable orbit. That is if it isn't disturbed. These points are now known as the Lrange points. And while they didn't help solve the free body problem, Lrunch was developing more sophisticated tools. In fact, he developed an entirely new way of doing mechanics. But for that to work, he didn't just need the potential. He needed the potential energy and the kinetic energy, too. I think when people hear potential, they think potential energy. And while they're very similar, there is a subtle difference. If you have the potential, that's basically the field corresponding to a single body. Then it will have some potential [music] field around it, which is described as P = minus G M over R, where this is the mass of the sun. But to get the potential energy, we need to add in a second body. So let's s"

    "transcript": "This is a video of light traveling through a bottle at 250 billion frames per second. And here's that same video, but now with the camera moving. You can see it sweeps across the scene faster than the laser pulse itself. Which means this camera must be traveling faster than light. So, how is this possible? Well, in this video, I want to show you three unusual ways of stopping time and what you can see if you just keep slowing down. From a century old technique that still beats modern slow-mo cameras all the way to a massive quadrillion frames per second camera that captures electrons whizzing around molecules. By the 1920s, electric motors were the new standard for powering factories and mills. But many of these motors also came with a flaw. They were sensitive to fluctuations in the electrical grid. A power surge, like from a lightning strike, made them behave unpredictably. So, one MIT engineer named Harold Doc Edertton set out to find a solution. He had a setup that could induce these power surges in a lab. But no matter what he tried, Edertton just couldn't see what was going on with the motors because the machines would spin too fast for the human eye to see. And cameras at the time offered no help. Their exposure times were too slow. So any photograph of a running motor would come out blurry. But one day, Edertton noticed that every time he triggered a power surge, his equipment gave off a bright flash of light. And when [music] that flash hit the motor, the moving parts appeared to stand perfectly still, as if frozen in time, which gave him an idea. He could turn off all the lights in the room, set up a camera, and leave the shutter open. And since there was no light, no image would form on the film. But then if he could illuminate the motor with a very brief and very bright flash like the ones his equipment gave off, well then he would get a sharp photograph. All Editton needed was a way to reliably create these flashes. So he started by using a high voltage power source to load electrons onto a capacitor [music] where they piled up onto one of the plates. But because there was an insulator slotted between the two sides, the electrons couldn't just jump to the positive side to balance out the charges. The only way for them to get there would be to travel through the rest of the circuit. And the circuit was intentionally designed so that electrons would have to cross a glass tube filled with a non-conducting gas like argon or xenon. On their own, they would not have the energy to get through that gas. So, Edgutin added a trigger that sent a high voltage pulse through a wire wrapped around the tube. and the electric field from that pulse would rip electrons off the gas atoms inside the chamber, ionizing the gas and turning it into a conductor. In that instant, the charge stored in the capacitor would surge through, heating the gas to around 10,000 Kelvin, nearly twice as hot as the surface of the sun. This would produce a very bright and very brief flash of light lasting just 10 micro seconds. Then the electrons would recombine with the gas atoms, stopping the current, and the circuit would go dark again. This was Edertton's strobe. By the early 1930s, he was eager to test it outside the lab. So, he packed up a strobe and hit the road with his wife. When he saw a random factory, he pulled over, got inside the nearest phone booth, and called up the facto's president and asked him something like, \"Do you happen to have any motors in there that don't work right? I'd like to show you something.\" More often than not, he ended up inside setting up the strobe next to one of the motors. The workers would watch as Edertton froze the motor in time, allowing them to take sharp pictures of the gears in motion. Edertton isn't the first to make a strobe. Rather, he took new bits of technology that existed so he could make a better strobe. A strobe that was brighter, shorter flash duration. But he was not unique in that. There were lots of electrical engineers in the world at that time who could have done that. >> No. What Edertton uniquely brought to the table was his eye for photography. >> He took photos of synchronous motors and I think in part because he just thought synchronous motors were cool. One day he showed his wife the 300th photo of a synchronous motor. >> Mhm. >> And she said, \"Harold, can't you take a picture of something a little more interesting?\" >> And so he did. [music] >> Tennis balls pancaked against the racket, hummingbirds frozen in time. He was one of the first to really start using strobes to communicate what's happening at these time scales we [music] can't see. He would do this through like Life magazine, National Geographic magazines. These magazines in the 30s40s were essentially the social media influencers of the day. He just had this eye for composition. Most of these pictures were taken in the 1930s. And yeah, it seems easy enough to swing a racket and it's easy enough [music] to p"

    "transcript": "This is a microchip. When you zoom in, you find a nanoscopic computing city. Skyscrapers hundreds of layers tall with hundreds of kilometers of wires connecting everything. And at the very bottom is this transistors, billions of them. They are the ones and zeros of our computer. The chip works by whizzing electrons from transistor to transistor. And the smaller you can make those transistors, the less the signals have to travel. So the faster they can compute. Plus, you can fit more [music] transistors into the same area, resulting in a much more powerful chip. So, for over 50 years, transistors got smaller and smaller, and the number you could fit on a chip doubled every 2 years. This became known as Moore's law, named for Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore after he noticed the pattern back in 1965, and it's been one of the main drivers of the tech industry. But around 2015, progress [music] came to a screeching halt. And we might have never gotten past it if it wasn't for a single company that makes these machines. The machines that saved Moors law. Holy. This is a video about the most complicated commercial product humanity's ever built. That's insane. It costs a whopping $400 million. And it is so bizarre that I want to introduce it to you with a thought experiment. Imagine you are shrunk down to the size of an end and you're given a laser that's strong enough to melt through metal like butter. Next, a tiny droplet of molten tin, roughly the size of a white blood cell, is shot out in front of you around 250 km hour. And your task is to hit this not once, not twice, but three times in a row in 20 micro seconds with your little laser. Well, that is exactly what this machine [music] does. It hits one tiny tin droplet three times in a row, heating each one up to over 220,000 Kelvin. That's roughly 40 times hotter than the surface of the sun. And it doesn't just hit one droplet, it hits 50,000 droplets every single second. >> How often do you miss a laser shot? >> We don't miss them. >> What? You do 150,000 laser shots a second and you don't miss one. >> Exactly. The same machine also contains mirrors that might just be the smoothest objects in the universe. If you scale one up to the size of the Earth, then the largest bump would be no thicker than a playing card. On top of that, it is able to overlay one layer of a chip perfectly on top of another and never be off by more than five atoms. And this is all happening while parts of the machine whip around at accelerations of over 20 GS. For 30 years, almost everyone thought that actually building this machine was impossible. And yet, it exists. There is only one company in the world that can make it. So, what is this company? And what is this impossible machine they've built? This video is sponsored by Brilliant. More about them at the end of the show. Now, just as a quick aside, the makers of this machine didn't actually sponsor this video. We just thought that the science and engineering here were so cool that we had to make a video about it. So, let's jump straight in. To make a microchip, you start by taking silicon dioxide, usually from sand, and purifying it into ultra pure, nearly 100% silicon chunks, which is then melted down in a special furnace. Next, you lower a small seed crystal into the vat. Silicon atoms attach to the crystal, extending its structure. Then you slowly raise the seed crystal while rotating it. And this results in a large single crystal silicon ingot. >> This is where the seed crystal would be >> and then you pull it out. >> Can I touch it? >> Yeah, you can. >> It seems like you would not be able to hold this from here. >> Yes. >> It even feels fragile like if you kind of >> Yeah. I'm scared to break it. >> Yes. >> He's using more force. >> The ingot is then cut into wafers with diamond wire saws. Up to 5,000 of them. after which each wafer is carefully polished. Next, it's coated with a light sensitive material called photoresist. [music] There are different kinds, but in a positive photoresist, the areas exposed to light become weaker and more soluble. So, if you shine light through a patterned mask, you can selectively weaken parts of that coating. [music] Then, you rinse the wafer with a basic solution to wash away the exposed photoresist, leaving the design imprinted. [music] So, now you can actually turn this pattern into physical structures. This is often done by etching into the uncovered silicon by using either chemicals or plasma. And then you deposit a metal like copper to fill in those etched lines. As a last step, you wash away the remaining photoresist. And now you've made a single layer of the chip. We've simplified this cycle down to the main steps. Coat, [music] expose, etch, and deposit. It repeats for every single chip layer. And depending on the chip, there could be anywhere from 10 to 100 layers. The bottom layer is the [music] transistors. This is the most complicated layer, requiring hundreds of steps that all "

    "transcript": "Am I retiring? That is the question I will answer in this video. And you can skip ahead to the answer if you like, but I think it'll make more sense if I explain. You know, I started this YouTube channel in 2011 after quitting my full-time job. >> And welcome to Veritassium in units of kilogram. >> I was teaching around 15 hours a [music] week to pay the bills. This is a represent >> but the other 40 to 50 hours per week I spent making videos on this channel and I [music] didn't do it for the money >> gives math to the other subatomic >> I don't think anyone who started at that time did because there was basically no money to be made in my first year working full-time I made $840 in my second year I earned $12,000 the real reason I made Veritassium is because it allowed me to combine the [music] three things that I always loved doing the most. Learning about science, teaching, and creating, like performing, and making [music] videos. I did not get into this to start a business. I personally think I'd be terrible at selling things. I'm not one of those people who can say, \"You've got to try this. It'll change your life.\" You know, back in 2015, I kickstarted a magnetic molecular modeling kit called SNATMS, and I still sell it on Amazon, but I hardly ever mention it because I don't want to bother you. And I figure if you're looking for something like that, well, maybe you'll find it. Hello. Very nice. Thank you. I almost never ask you to like, comment, or subscribe. Thank you for watching because I figure you know what you want to do. And [music] I'm not a growth hacker. We don't sell cheap merch. No t-shirts or hoodies. I want you to get more value out of me than I get out of you. You know, the only thing that I am really passionate about is the truth. And the best way to get to the truth is through science. Our universe is an extraordinary place. And I think most people go through life oblivious to how it actually [music] works. How does the boat go forwards? >> Yeah, it's okay. Then well again [laughter] well I know I know it does [music] but again I don't have all the answers. >> I think that's not just unfortunate it has real negative consequences. To give an example in 1958 Dr. Benjamin Spock published in his book Baby and Child Care that babies should be put down to sleep on their fronts rather than their backs to prevent them from choking on their own vomit. And this book outsold every other book except the Bible for its 52-year print run. So, it [music] was pretty influential. But when empirical studies showed that babies sleeping on their fronts were actually more likely to die from sudden infant death [music] syndrome, well, the book was not promptly updated. It was printed with the same bad advice for decades, [music] leading to an estimated 50,000 unnecessary deaths. The point is, we lead better, happier lives when they're in accordance with how the world actually is rather than just how it appears to be or how we'd like it to be. That is why an undercurrent of every video is how do we know what's true? How would we know if we were wrong? [music] Because I want to increase the level of critical thinking in the world. That is the fundamental mission of Veritasium. >> Now, so far this is basically just like >> by 2013 I was fortunate enough that this dream job YouTube channel started to produce enough income to live off. So I quit all of the work and this has been my main gig ever since. I can't believe all the things I've gotten to do. And I want to thank you, someone who's watched at least one of these videos, for making [music] it possible. But I have to acknowledge my biggest fear and what I think is the biggest challenge facing any creator, which is precariousness. This is a job that comes with a lot of uncertainty. I mean, how much you make in any given month depends on how many views your channel got in that month. And then there's the comment section and the fact that your sense of self-worth is basically tied to how well your videos are received. But by far the biggest source of uncertainty is just not knowing when this is all going to end. Like when are you going to upload your last successful video? When are you no longer going to be able to make a living doing what you have been doing? In 2018, I had a call with my contact at YouTube who told me I needed to quote stay relevant. Yeah, that stung a bit. Now, I'm not going to name names, but I have seen friends and other creators who have stopped making stuff for a whole bunch of reasons. Like, maybe they've gotten injured or gotten really sick. I know of other YouTubers who've been cancelled or demonetized. I mean, there's just a million ways for things to go wrong and only really one way for them to continue to go right. I think by far the scariest proposition is that the YouTube algorithm just stops showing your videos to people. I think that's the scariest because it is so common and it's completely out of your control. A violinist pla"

    "transcript": "In 1935, Einstein [music] came up with a thought experiment that showed quantum mechanics breaks one of the most sacred principles [music] in physics, that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. Physicists assumed he was wrong. [music] They thought that at 56, Einstein was an old man past his prime and just unable to accept the new theory of physics because it [music] was too radical. But 30 years later, one man stumbled across Einstein's forgotten paper when he realized something. The prediction could actually be tested. When scientists ran the experiment, they were shocked. Quantum physics really does break the universal [music] speed limit. We're obliged to invoke something like actions going faster than light from one place to another. >> This is a video about one of the spookiest [music] and most misunderstood experiments in all of physics. And it [music] might even be the strongest evidence we have that we live in many worlds. If the sun were to disappear all of a sudden, how long would it take until we noticed and were released out into space? Newton's theory says that gravity acts instantly across any distance. So, if there's a change in gravity, we should feel it immediately. But Newton himself was disturbed by this. That one body may act upon another at a distance is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. But in 1905, Einstein realized [music] action at a distance isn't just absurd. It leads to outright paradoxes. Einstein had discovered that observers moving at different speeds can disagree about when events happened. Let's say you see two things happen at the same time. An observer speeding past would see it differently. To them, one of these happened first, and both points of view are equally valid. But in the case of gravity, this leads to disaster. Say you see the sun disappearing and earth flying off at the same time as Newton predicted. Then the other observer sees something impossible. They see the earth flying off first even while the sun is still there. And it should of course be pulling the earth in. So to them it looks like cause and effect are reversed. The only way out of this paradox is to reject the assumption we started with. So gravity can't be instant. It took Einstein 10 years to fix this issue and in the process he completely overhauled our understanding of gravity. Gravity is caused by the bending of spacetime. [music] When there's a change in gravity that only affects the local spacetime and then that ripple spreads out to nearby regions which spread farther out until eventually [music] they reach us. This theory of gravity is local because effects spread from place to place at the speed of light instead of being instant. From our frame of reference, if the sun disappeared, that ripple would take about 8 minutes to reach us. Another observer might disagree about the length of the delay, but now we all agree that the sun disappeared first. This is why nothing can go faster than light. The delay between cause and effect [music] ensures all observers agree on the order. After Einstein fixed gravity, all of classical physics obeyed this important rule. But then Einstein studied the new theory of quantum mechanics and made a terrible discovery. This is one of the most famous photographs in physics. It was taken at the 1927 SVE conference where the architects of the brand new quantum theory gathered to discuss it. Around 60% of the attendees would win Nobel prizes. But Einstein thought they'd gotten something fundamentally wrong, and this was his chance to prove it. So, he took to the stage with a thought experiment. Imagine you fire a single electron through a narrow slit toward a circular detection screen. Well, quantum mechanics says that this electron has some sort of wave associated with it called a wave function which spreads out through space as it travels. When the electron hits the screen, you detect it at a single point. Where it turns up depends on the amplitude of the wave. If the wave is very big in a particular area, the electron is more likely to turn up there. Let's say it appears here. So far, everyone was following. This is what quantum mechanics predicts. But Einstein's next question surprised them. Why doesn't the electron turn up at this other spot a moment later? There's only one electron, so we can't detect it twice. But the way quantum mechanics ensures this is that when the electron was detected at the first spot, its wave function collapsed to zero everywhere else instantly. That's why the probability of finding it at the second spot is now zero. There's no longer any wave there. But Einstein asked the audience to think about what this means. The measurement here must instantly affect the wave function over here. No matter how far apart these locations are. In other words, quantum mechanics requires instant influences across distance. It violates locality. Einstein concluded"

    "transcript": "In 1928, a young man shuffled onto a stage in Germany to present a lecture [music] on his recent work. He had a slightly unusual presentation style. Physicist Eugene Vner described the lecture as detached, almost like a recitation of a technical text. He said the man spoke without giving any sign [music] of enjoying his own lecture. But the work this strange, unassuming man presented was about to send some of the most famous quantum physicists of the 20th century spiraling. After the lecture, Verer Heisenberg described the man's theory as the saddest chapter in modern physics. Heisenberg also wrote to Neils Bore and said, \"I find the present situation quite absurd.\" And on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field. Legend has it that Wolf Gang Pie even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics and then he started writing a utopian novel. What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly? Well, he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today. The unification of Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics. And his work had revealed something troubling. A particle unlike any seen in the world. A particle with negative energy. In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity. It was based on the simple idea that for anyone moving with constant speed, the laws of physics should be the same. And this includes any measurement of the speed of light. So it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed [music] to be 300 million meters/s. This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed like time and space [music] have to transform so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value. In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all. They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar. When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease. And the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared. In other words, he found that energy must be equal to MC^². [music] E= MC². Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing. >> So a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass giving a new relationship between energy and momentum. Now if we take the square root of both sides we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum. And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve where mc^ squ the rest mass energy of the object is the lowest possible value for energy. But really when we took the square root, we should have put a plus minus out front which would give us two curves. One for positive energies and another for negative energies. But we don't observe things that have energy less than zero. I mean what would that even mean? So in classical physics the solution is simple. You just ignore the negative energy solutions. They can't physically represent anything. Right, [music] Casper? Well, sure that sounds right. But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions. First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles like electrons, they weren't continuous at all. They were discrete. And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves. So if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, [music] then they would create interference patterns just like light does. What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics. And in 1926, Irwin Shinger formalized this field by coming up with his now famous wave equation, which describes how quantum mechanical systems evolve over time. This was the most radical new theory of the 20th century and and would remain so. This is not a bit like Newton or a bit like Maxwell. This was radically new. The equation solution called the wave function s does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would. But instead the modulus squar can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time. Deriving the Schroinger equation is actually surprisingly simple. Just start by writing down the total energy, which for a free particle is just its kinetic energy, a half mv^ 2. And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum. Mass time velocity. So kinetic energy [music] is just momentum squared / 2 m. Now we're going to make this quantum. And to do that, we need two things. [music] The first is the wave function sigh which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales. And the "

    "transcript": "Some things are not normal. By that I mean if you go out in the world and start measuring things like human height, IQ or the size of apples on a tree, you will find that for each of these things, most of the data clusters around some average value. This is so common that we call it the normal distribution. But some things in life are not like this. Nature shows power laws all over the place. That seems weird. Like is nature tuning itself to criticality? >> If you make a crude measure of how big is the world war by how many people it kills, you find that it follows a power law. The outcome will vary in size over 10 million, 100 million. >> It's much more likelihood of really big events than you would expect from a normal distribution and they will totally skew the average. >> The system you're looking at doesn't have any inherent physical scale. It's really hard to know what's going to happen next. The more you measure, the bigger the average is, which is really weird. It sounds impossible. >> It's it's very important to try to understand, you know, which game you're playing. And what are the payoffs going to be in the in the long run? >> In the late 1800s, Italian engineer Vilfredo Paro stumbled upon something no one had seen before. See, he suspected there might be a hidden pattern in how much money people make. So he gathered income tax records from Italy, England, France and [music] other European countries. And for each country, he plotted the distribution of income. Each country he looked at, he saw the same pattern, a pattern which still holds in most countries to this day. And it's not a normal distribution. If you think about a normal distribution like height, there's a clearly defined average. And extreme outliers basically never happen. I mean, you're never going to find someone who is, say, five times the average height. That would be physically impossible. But Paro's income distributions were different. Take this curve for England. It shows the number of people who earn more than a certain income. The curve starts off declining steeply. Most people earn relatively little, but then it falls away gradually, much more slowly than a normal distribution would, and it spans several orders of magnitude. There were people who earned five times, 10 times, even a 100 times more than others. That kind of spread just wouldn't happen if income were normally distributed. Now to shrink this huge spread of data, Paro calculated the logarithms of all the values and plotted those instead. In other words, he used a log log plot. And when he did that, the broad curve transformed into a straight line. The gradient was around -1.5. That means each time you double the income, say from 200 to 400 lb, the number of people earning at least that amount drops off by a factor of 2 to the^ of 1.5, which is around 2.8. And this pattern holds for every doubling of income. So paro could describe the distribution of incomes with one simple equation. The number of people who earn an income greater than or equal to x is proportional to 1 /x to the power of 1.5. Now that's what Paro saw for England. But he performed the same analysis on data from Italy, France, Prussia and a bunch of other countries. And he saw the same thing again and again. Each time the data transformed into a straight line and the gradients were remarkably similar. That meant paro could describe the income distribution in each country with the same equation one over the income to some power where that power is just the absolute gradient of the logarithmic graph. This type of relationship is called a power law. When you move from the world of normal distributions to the world of power laws, things change dramatically. So to illustrate this, let's take a trip to the casino to play three different games. At table number one, you get 100 tosses of a coin. Each time you flip and it lands on heads, you win $1. So the question is, how much would you be prepared to pay to play this game? Well, we need to work out how much you'd expect to win in this game and then pay less than that expected value. So the probability of throwing a head is 1/2. Multiply that by $1 and multiply that by 100 tosses. That gives you an expected payout of $50. So, you should be willing to pay anything less than $50 to play this game. Sure, you might not win every time, but if you play the game hundreds of times, the small variations either side of the average will cancel out and you can expect to turn a profit. One of the first people to study this kind of problem was Abraham Demo in the early 1700s. He showed that if you plot the probability of each outcome, you get a bell-shaped curve, which was later coined the normal distribution. Normal distributions. The traditional explanation is that when there are a lot of effects that are random that are adding up, that's when you expect normals. So like how tall I am depends on a lot of random things about my nutrition, about my parents' genetics, "

    "transcript": "This is one of the most powerful jet engines in the world. And it actually runs at temperatures 250° C hotter than the melting point of the materials that make it up. >> That's 12,200°. >> So the question is, why doesn't a jet engine just melt into a puddle? We are right at the boundaries of the laws of physics. >> That is wild. It's at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine. But here, they're liquid. Every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking, \"This is never going to work.\" >> And yet, it does work. Right now, there are over 10,000 planes in the sky powered by engines just like these. Maybe you are on one right now. So, how do they work? This is a jet engine, specifically a turboan engine. At the front is this giant fan. During takeoff, these rotating blades push 1.3 tons of air backwards every second, and around 10% of that air gets compressed. The compressors force the air into increasingly narrow chambers. They compress the air to about 50 times atmospheric pressure. And just by doing that, the air heats up to around 600° C. This compressed air is then forced into the combustion chamber where fuel is sprayed in through a ring of nozzles and ignited. That chemical reaction gives off a lot of heat. So the temperature jumps to around 1,500° C. So now you've got this high pressure gas from the combuster that just wants to expand. And now it's got an incredible amount of thermal energy. But between the combustion chamber and the outside air is this rows of turbine blades. So in order for the gas to expand and get out, it needs to push these turbine blades out of the way. And in pushing the blades, that is how it transfers its energy to the engine. This is where all the power really comes from. In modern jets, on takeoff, each high-pressure turbine blade is generating as much power as a Formula 1 car. And there are 68 of them. As the gas rushes through the turbine and nozzle, its pressure drops from around 50 atmospheres down to one, and it expands by almost 20 times. And that spins these turbine blades up to 12,500 revolutions per minute. The fan that is pushing all that air backward and all those compressors that squeeze the air down, all of that is powered by the turbines back here. It's a kind of funny, really counterintuitive way to think about an engine. It's what's happening in the back that's actually driving everything up front. As the hot exhaust gas is shot out the back of the engine, it pushes the engine forward. That generates thrust. But did you know that in a modern passenger jet, this accounts for less than 20% the thrust of the engine? The vast majority of the thrust, over 80% of it, just comes from that big fan at the front of the jet. Remember how only 10% of the incoming air gets compressed? The other 90% bypasses all that. It's simply propelled backwards by the fan. and it goes right around the guts of the engine and comes straight out the back. The fan pushes that air backwards. So, the air pushes the fan forwards. That's how you get 80% of the thrust. It's basically a huge ducted propeller. So, why do it this way? I mean, why not compress all the incoming air and put it all through the combustion chamber and turbines? Well, some fighter jets do exactly this, and it makes for very powerful engines, but they're also horribly inefficient. To see why, remember that the [music] impulse pushing the plane forward is equal to the change in the momentum of the air backwards. So, you've got options. For example, you could push twice as much air back half as fast, or you could push half as much air back twice as fast. Both will generate the exact same impulse, but the kinetic energy of the air is proportional to V squared. [music] So it takes four times as much energy to speed up the air in the second case. And a lot of that energy is just wasted in [music] the exhaust. So ideally, you want to push as much air backwards as possible with only a [music] small change in velocity. That's why jets have gotten bigger and bigger over the years. and the increasing fraction of bypass air has the added benefit that it surrounds the hot exhaust gases and that reduces noise coming away from the jet. But there is another major factor when it comes to engine efficiency and that is temperature. At cruising altitudes around 35,000 ft the outside air is around55° C while inside the engine it's over 1,500°. The hot high-pressure gas inside the engine wants to expand into the much colder, lower pressure air outside. It's that difference that lets the engine turn heat into useful work. But there's a fundamental limit to how much work any heat engine can get from that. It's called the carno efficiency. It's equal to 1 minus the temperature of the cold outside air divided by the temperature of the hot gas inside the combustion chamber. So looking at this, you can improve the efficiency of the engine in two ways. Either fly where the air is colder or raise the temperature in [music] the combustion "
